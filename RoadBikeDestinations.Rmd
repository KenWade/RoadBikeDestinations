## Introduction for Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet

* Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

* Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

#####Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

##Review criteria

###The rubric contains the following two questions:

* Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?

* Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(readxl)

## Setup Paths and Filenames

XLS_filename = "C:/Users/Ken/Documents/Ken/Continuing Education/Johns Hopkins School of Public Health - Data Science 9 - Developing Data Products/CourseWork/Week 2/RoadBikeDestinations.xlsx"
icon_Filename = "C:/Users/Ken/Documents/Ken/Continuing Education/Johns Hopkins School of Public Health - Data Science 9 - Developing Data Products/CourseWork/Week 2/icon_small.png"
  
## Read XLS file and fix (by that I mean remove) the last row that is read in from the xls file

df = read_excel(XLS_filename, sheet=1, col_names = TRUE, col_types = c("text", "numeric", "numeric", "text"))
df=df[-nrow(df), ]

## Next improvement will be to remove all NA Latitude & Longitude rows from the data frame

## Making Custom Markers

bikeIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = icon_Filename,
  iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16)

## Get Custom Sites

bikeSites = paste("Photo Link: ", "<b><a href='", df$`Site URL`, "'>", df$`Location Name`, "</a></b>", sep = "")

## Make Map

df[1:24,c("Latitude", "Longitude")] %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = bikeIcon, popup = bikeSites)
```
